# How to run?

1. Run [Cifar-10.ipynb](example_notebooks/Cifar_data.ipynb) file to download and prepare data.
2. Run [Backdoor-Unlearning](example_notebooks/Backdoor-Unlearning.ipynb)

Current error: ValueError: The filename must end in `.weights.h5`. Received: filepath=/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/Unlearning/MachineUnlearning/models/poisoning/budget-10000/seed-42/first-order/repaired_model.hdf5
(Expecting .weights.h5 file but getting .hdf5; But i believe I am using .hdf5 everywhere)
Try to run on GPU
